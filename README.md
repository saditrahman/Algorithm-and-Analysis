# Algorthm-Analysis
Abstract:

I created this repo to test different algorithms about how they can sort numbers/trees. If you are working with algorithms and want to test, I know it is hard to find sources to code and then again. Simple clone my repo or fork it. If your contribution is good, I can accept those changes. 

This is a repository that runs algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc. 

Files that contains here are:

1) Merge.java
2) BubbleSort.java
3) SelectionSort.java
4) Quick.java

All these file contains an array that is sorted or a tree that is sorted. 

To run, open your favorite IDE and then run it.

Alternate Way:

Open CMD where this file is located.
Enter: javac *.java
Enter: java <class to run>
